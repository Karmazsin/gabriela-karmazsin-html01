  <p>
    In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
    supporting branches and leaves in most species.
    In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower,
    including only woody plants with secondary growth,
    plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.
